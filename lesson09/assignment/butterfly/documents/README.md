#SEO TACTICS

This directory explains the SEO tactics as explained by Cyrus Shepard in his article "A Must-Have Keyword Research Process for Winning SEO" see link below

SUMMARY: Cyrus explains his method for cultivating effective SEO for a client's websites. He says that the myth of SEO is that it is all about finding the best tool, but it is instead about using the best process to find the most effective search terms.

This process is given in three steps. Step 1 find the best seed keywords for your site. This is done by asking three questions: what do I want to rank for (if I own a pet shop do, I want people to find my site using "feed supplies" or "pet toys"), what do I already rank for (using keyword research tools see which search terms the pet shop ranks for right now and how high it does so), what do my competitors rank for (a similar search but using competing pet shops). Step 2 is list building, or taking those seed keywords and putting them into keyword research tools which will generate a list of keywords sorted by ranks such as volume or relevance, then use those terms to get even more seed keywords. Step 3 is to do competitor analysis. This involves either doing keyword engine analysis of what keywords the competitor is using (and how those words rank for them), or putting their keywords into Google search and seeing where they, the competitors, rank.

If all three steps are followed, the effective developer will come up with the most best words to put into the page to give it the highest ranking.

IMPLEMENTATION: In order for this site to get the best SEO ranking possible (at least in the humble opinion of the proprietors), we will implement the three strategies listed above (e.g. using seed keyword searches, building a list using keyword research tools, checking out what competing butterfly sites are using for search terms). It is best to remember the purpose of the site is not commercial retail, but instead the entertainment, education and community building of butterfly enthusiasts, therefore competing sites selling butterflies or butterfly supplies will not be considered. But social media links and URL links to other relevant butterfly sites will be highly useful not only in the site's SEO, but also in implementing its mission statement.
